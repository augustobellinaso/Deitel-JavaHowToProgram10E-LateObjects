/*Use a two-dimensional array to solve the following problem: A company has
four salespeople (1 to 4) who sell five different products (1 to 5). Once a day, each salesperson passes
in a slip for each type of product sold. Each slip contains the following:
a) The salesperson number
b) The product number
c) The total dollar value of that product sold that day
Thus, each salesperson passes in between 0 and 5 sales slips per day. Assume that the information
from all the slips for last month is available. Write an application that will read all this information for
last monthâ€™s sales and summarize the total sales by salesperson and by product. All totals should be
stored in the two-dimensional array sales . After processing all the information for last month, dis-
play the results in tabular format, with each column representing a salesperson and each row repre-
senting a particular product. Cross-total each row to get the total sales of each product for last month.
Cross-total each column to get the total sales by salesperson for last month. Your output should
include these cross-totals to the right of the totaled rows and to the bottom of the totaled columns.*/
