/*Draw 12 concentric circles in the center of a JPanel (Fig. 4.26). The innermost circle
should have a radius of 10 pixels, and each successive circle should have a radius 10 pixels larger than
the previous one. Begin by finding the center of the JPanel . To get the upper-left corner of a circle,
move up one radius and to the left one radius from the center. The width and height of the bound-
ing rectangle are both the same as the circleâ€™s diameter (i.e., twice the radius).*/
